# Erlang/Elixir Vagrant

This project is currently targeted towards creating a Vagrant box to work on Riak client app development. The only changes for Riak are some build tools, so it's generally open to any sort of Elixir development.

It's assumed you will clone another project into `/vagrant` and work on it separately.

## TODO

- [ ] Make the version selection of Erlang/OTP and Elixir not be hard-coded 
- [ ] Allow the creation of multiple boxes with different versions at the same time.
